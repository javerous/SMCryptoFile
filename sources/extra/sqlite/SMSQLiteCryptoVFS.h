/*
 * -- Informations --
 *
 * This VFS :
 * - Doesn't manage file locking. Locking are not-ops, like the "unix-none" vfs. Just be sure that your application is the only one accessing your base.
 * - Doesn't manage shared memory. If you want to use Write-Ahead Logging (WAL), you have to use EXCLUSIVE locking_mode.
